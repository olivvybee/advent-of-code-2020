# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my answers for the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2020](adventofcode.com/2020), a Christmas-themed programming challenge.

Each folder is numbered and represents the date the puzzles are from. There are two puzzles each day.

I will likely be solving all the puzzles using `Node.js`.
